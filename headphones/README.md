# Implementing a design from scratch 
**Responsive Web design | HTML | CSS**

***

In the project, the task is to implement a design shared through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/Ax2P0DTnTrFhZn00dGbykp/a5366bbd595c643993665e2a28909370a7e12c66?node-id=0-362&t=UKWTF5uMvQ1fLvV2-1) from scratch using HTML and CSS.
The idea is to have a mobile-first approach by first creating a version for mobile and then adapting to different screen sizes for desktop and tablet using media queries.
